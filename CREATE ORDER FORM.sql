SELECT * FROM product;

INSERT INTO form (CustomerNumber) SELECT CustomerNumber FROM customer;
SELECT * FROM form;
1234	0	1998-11-04
INSERT INTO form (CustomerNumber) SELECT CustomerNumber FROM customer;
	Note: When I queried the CustomerNumber from the Customer table to insert into the Form table, it would not insert.
			the resulting value is 0 for customer number.  The syntax I used is above.
